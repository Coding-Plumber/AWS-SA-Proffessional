# An IAM Users has 1 username and 1 password 
- An IAM User can have two access keys 
- Access keys can be created, deleted, made inactive or made active

# Access key ID - 
# Secret Access Key 

given both these when creating credentials, you can only see the Secret Access Key once when first given it so needs to be noted down. We can have two sets so when we hear the term 'rotating access keys' we can update the applications to use the new keys and delete the old ones
